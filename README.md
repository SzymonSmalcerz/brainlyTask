# Flashcards app

Internship challenge (Brainly 2018)

## App specification

Create   a   single   page   flashcard   webapp   that   loads   data   from   external   URL   -  
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vergilius/6d869a7448e405cb52d782120b77b82c/raw/e75dc7c19b918a9f0f5684595899dba2e5ad4f43/history-flashcards.json.  
Flashcards  should  be  presented   as   cards   (one   at   a   time)   with   questions   and   two   answers   (only   one   of   them   is   valid).   For  
each   flashcard   user   should   be   able   to   choose   one   of   the   answers.   Choosing   invalid   answer  
should   move   card   to   the   end   of   the   deck,   and   valid   answer   removes   card   from   the   deck.   After  
adding correct answer to all questions users should get feedback on their performance.

All the details that are not specified above are left for the developer to decide.
